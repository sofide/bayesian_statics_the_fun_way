# Bayesian Statistics Playground in Python

This repository contains my personal experiments while learning Bayesian statistics, 
mostly inspired by the book _"Bayesian Statistics the Fun Way"_ by Will Kurt.

The goal is to translate ideas and examples (often originally in R) into **Python**, 
and to build intuition through **code, plots, and simulations**.

> ⚠️ Disclaimer: This repo is not a polished library or a structured course.
> It’s mostly a collection of personal experiments, rough notebooks, and
> scratch code as I learn Bayesian statistics 😅
